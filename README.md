Overwatch is a .NET-based server backend supporting 24/7 uptime with a kubernetes-inspired infrastructure.

Overwatch also supports updating itself and the production build with no downtime, handling HTTPS and HTTP requests separately, and provides optional hosting of a private root-server instance.

## Important
Updating, configurations files and complex proxy management are not yet implemented. The readme will be updated accordingly when features are implemented.
